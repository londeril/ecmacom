# WireGuard Manager

This script automates the process of managing WireGuard peers, including adding, removing, and listing them. Upon initial execution, the script generates a configuration file named `wg-manager.conf` in the same directory where it was run. This configuration file contains all the necessary variables for WireGuard Manager to function properly.

## Installation

1. Copy or create a symbolic link to the script in a directory within your system's PATH.
2. Run `wg-manager` once to generate the initial configuration file.
3. Edit the `wg-manager.conf` file to match your WireGuard server settings.
