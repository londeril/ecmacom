# Ecmacom Code Base

Welcome to the Ecmacom Code Base repository, a collection of open-source scripts designed for the automation and maintenance of our infrastructure. We encourage you to use and modify these scripts to suit your needs. We kindly request that you provide attribution by linking back to this repository when using our scripts, unless you've significantly modified them to create an entirely new work.

## Disclaimer

Please note that while these scripts function effectively in our environment, we cannot guarantee their performance on all systems. As such, we operate under the "it works on our machines" principle. We kindly ask that you refrain from opening issues if the scripts do not work as expected on your specific setup.

## Contributions

We welcome contributions that enhance the overall performance and functionality of our scripts. If you'd like to contribute, please submit a pull request for our review.
