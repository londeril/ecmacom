# Ecmacom Code Base
This repo contains scripts for automation and maintenance of our infrastructure. The scripts in this repo are open source and can be used and modified in any shape or form. We only ask that you link back to this repo when using scripts from it. Unless the script was heavily modified and is a new creation in its own right.

As always: The scripts come with the usual "it works on our machines" disclaimer. Please don^t open issues if the scripts do not work on your systems.

We are happy to consider pull requests if you are contributing to the overall performance of the scripts :)
